# DSA in C

Welcome to the **DSA in C** repository! This repository contains a collection of basic programs  and implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts in the C programming language(**25+ programs**).
This repository also have  programs involving practical implementation of DSA. These programs are designed to help you understand and practice DSA concepts.

## Programs Included

1. BFS Traversal using Graph
2. Line Counter
3. Binary Tree Implementation
4. Hanoi Tower
5. Polynomial Addition
6. Singly Linked List
7. Queue Implementation using Linked List
8. Stack Implementation using Linked List
9. Queue Implementation using Array
10. Polynomial Addition
11. Polynomial Multiplication
12. Polynomial Subtraction
13. Browser History using Stacks
14. Singular Circular Linked List
15. Binary Search through Iteration
16. Bubble sort
17. Optimised Bubble Sort
18. Circular Queue using Array
19. Degenerate Tree
20. Double LinkedList
21. LinkedListed using Double Pointer Method
22. Full tree
23. Linear Search
24. Own code of insertion Sort
25. Own code of selection Sort
26. Traditional Selection Sort code
27. Searching in Binary Search Tree

## How to Use

Each directory contains a separate program along with the necessary files. You can navigate to each directory and explore the code. The programs are well-documented to provide insights into the implementation details.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or new DSA program implementations to contribute, feel free to create a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
